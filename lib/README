JAR files in this directory:

 * mouse.jar mouse-runtime.jar
   The Mouse parser generator. Website and manual can be found at:
   http://mousepeg.sourceforge.net/

   The parser generator is used to generate the
   app/controller/MarkupParser.java file. From the app/controller
   directory, this can be done with the command:

   java -cp ../../lib/mouse.jar mouse.Generate -G MarkupGrammar.peg -P MarkupParser -S MarkupSemantics -p controllers

   If someone is able to include this in the sbt build process,
   then that is a welcome adjustment.

 * bcrypt.jar
   The jBCrypt Java implementation of the BCrypt password hashing algorithm.
   Website and example can be found at:

   http://www.mindrot.org/projects/jBCrypt/

   import with:

   import org.mindrot.BCrypt;

 * sqlite.jar
   SQLite JDBC driver from:

   https://bitbucket.org/xerial/sqlite-jdbc

   Documentation of the JDBC interface can be found in the official
   Java documentation and many examples online. Check the
   http://www.sqlite.org/ website if SQL doesn't work as
   expected.

   See http://www.playframework.org/documentation/2.0.3/JavaDatabase
   for how to use JDBC with the Play framework.

 * sbt-launch.jar
   The SBT build tool, which the Play Framework is built on.
   This is included in case the Continuous Integration service does
   not provide it. Website and documentation is found at:

   http://www.scala-sbt.org/

   From the root of the project, you can use it to build the project
   with:

   java -Xmx512M -jar lib/sbt-launch.jar compile
